# My name is Ryan Halpin

I'm 24 and I'm currently operating out of north Dublin. Painting is the biggest passion in my life. It's like a therapy, a way for me to decompress. My background is heavily based on graffiti and street art , from a young age. It's from this I've moved to a more traditional medium in acrylics. The main subject of my work is the face. The slightest of adjustments can express such a wide array of emotions so simply. In seeing so many of these feelings being displayed on different faces each day It's easy to gain reference. Then blending these features together in a way that is still recognizable to be human but has an outer-worldly structure. Art to me should be about creating the unknown. Exploring our own interpretation of reality and not the one we are already being exposed to. Revealing your point of view to people, who without art would never connect with that frequency. I like each painting to have a personality, something you can relate with. something that switches on your imagination, that looks back at you almost like a mirror.
